sdesc: "Removes accents from characters (command)"
ldesc: "unac is a C library that removes accents from characters, 
regardless of the character set (ISO-8859-15, ISO-CELTIC, KOI8-RU...)  
as long as iconv(3) is able to convert it into UTF-16 (Unicode).  It 
provides a command line interface (unaccent) that removes accents from 
an input flow or a string given in argument. When using the library 
function or the command, the charset of the input must be specified. The 
input is converted to UTF-16 using iconv(3), accents are removed and the 
result is converted back to the original charset. The iconv -l command 
on GNU/Linux will show all charset supported."
